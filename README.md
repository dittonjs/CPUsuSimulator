# CPUsuSimulator
This app is a simulator for the CPU that students build in USU CS2810, that I am affectionately calling CPUsu. The purpose of this project is to provide a quicker way iterate on the assembler students write near the end of the semester. It might eliminate the need to teach MIPs as can use the simulator to teach the CPUsu instruction set directly.
